# rhythm-hell

This project contains a VR rhythm game inspired by Rhythm Heaven, and a level editor for rhythm games, both of which were made in [Godot 4.2](https://godotengine.org/download/archive/4.2-stable/).

This project was done under the supervision of Roi Poranne, as part of my duties towards a BSc in Computer Science at the [University of Haifa](https://www.haifa.ac.il/?lang=en).
