# rhythm-hell

This project contains a VR rhythm game inspired by Rhythm Heaven, and a level editor for rhythm games, both of which were made in [Godot 4.2](https://godotengine.org/download/archive/4.2-stable/).

This project was done under the supervision of Roi Poranne, as part of my duties towards a BSc in Computer Science at the [University of Haifa](https://www.haifa.ac.il/?lang=en).

## Features

### Game

The idea behind the project was to make a game containing several "micro" rhythm games which are all simple in their mechanics, can be picked up easily, and levels can be created easily for them.

The game (currently) features 3 micro games which are shown below:

### Level Editor

The level editor was designed to be generic, so that it could be used to make levels for any micro game.

Below is a video showcasing some of its features:

Each note and event has an id and some other values which can be used differently depending on which micro game is being played.


## Installation

Both the game and level editor can be downloaded from the releases. Simply extract the files and start the excecutable.
